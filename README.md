# Culinary-Delights


[Deployed-link] (https://culinary-delights.herokuapp.com/)


## Description

- This is a Recipe app that helps users to search for food recipe of their choice.

- The API used is not from the external API. I created the the API using HEROKO.

- While doing the project, i learnt that time is a necessity. Styling the projects takes time and there one needs to prepare wekk before starting the project. Creating the react app also takes time.

## Installation
Ensure you have npm installed on your computer.

- Fork this repository and clone it to your computer.
- In the folder where you've cloned it, cd into the cloned project
- If your terminal wasn't open before this, open it and run the commands below:

- ![#1589F0] (npm install)
- ![#1589F0] (npm start)

- This process will enable you to have your the project in your local environment but the link above (deployed link) should function similarly to running npm start.


## Credits
- There were no collaborators when i was doing the project.
- just giving credits to myslef for the hard work.
